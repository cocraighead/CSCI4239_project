Final Project CSCI 4239: Colin Craighead and Steven Priddy

This program will display two scenes one of a campground and one of a bar. 
Each scene will have a couple elements that used shaders to create.

 *  Key bindings:
 *  arrows             Change view angle
 *  space bar          Change view height up
 *  Shift+space bar    Change View height down
 *  m                  Toggle scene between scene 1 and 2
 *  0                  Reset View angle to a good spot in the scene
 *  l                  Turn light movement on/off
 *  [ and ]            Change light radius
 *  { and }            Change light height
 *  b/B                Toggle Fire fly blink
 *  ESC                Exit


 Move Around: To move the camera to a good position hit 0 and then piviot with the arrow keys. 
              Note that 0 doesn't go to 0,0,0. Which is where the camera starts at.
              Also use space bar and shift space bar to go up and down.      

 LOOK FOR:

 BAR
- Neon Sign made with geom shader with procedural texture lighting behind
- Bar walls and floor and some wood have normmaps
- Soda fountain with particle of soda coming out
- Record player with a record disc normmap

 Campground
- Terrain made from a texture
- Firefly particles - use b to turn them all on to see their movement
- Firework particles, watch the show
- Lake surface reflecting the terrain, sky and fireworks - also see if u can get a fire fly to blend with the lakes reflection
