Homework 9: Colin Craighead


This program curves a rectangle based on the cos function
The cos wave's wave length and anmplitude can be ajusted
The higher the amp and lower the wave length the more folds the rectangle needs

*  Key bindings:
 *  +/-        Number of folds
 *  a/A        Increase or dec amplitude of wave
 *  q/Q        Increase and dec wave length
 *  r          Reset folds, amp, and wave length to starting values
 *  arrows     Change view angle
 *  0          Set view angle to 0
 *  [ and ]    Change light position
 *  { and }    Change light height
 *  ESC        Exit
